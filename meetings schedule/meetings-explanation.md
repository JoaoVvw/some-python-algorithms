This code compares the available time from two persons, considering their work time and their already planned meetings.
It's objective is to output the periods of the day in which both persons would be able to have a meeting together.
In other words, the periods of the day in which both have free time in common.
The times are displayed based on a 24-hour clock, not using am nor pm.
